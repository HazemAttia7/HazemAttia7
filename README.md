### Hi, I'm Hazem!

ðŸŽ¯ **Flutter Developer | Passionate about Clean UI, UX, and Scalable Mobile Apps**

ðŸš€ I'm a **Flutter Developer** with a strong foundation in programming fundamentals and backend integration.  
Iâ€™m currently working at **Elevate Marketing & Business Solutions** as a *Junior Flutter Developer*, contributing to a large-scale mobile app for the Professional Syndicate Committee.

Although I have one month of professional experience, Iâ€™ve completed **23 programming courses** that gave me deep understanding of:
- Programming basics and object-oriented design  
- Backend concepts and ADO.NET  
- Data structures and algorithms  

I love turning creative ideas into real-world mobile applications that are functional, fast, and elegant.
